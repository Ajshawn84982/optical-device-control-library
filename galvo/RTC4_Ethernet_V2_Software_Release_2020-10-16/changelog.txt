Release Date 2020-10-16
*******************************************************************************

* BUGFIX: Fix API for C# and VB.net
    * Functions that wrap Delphi functions writing to LPSTR parameters are
      now expected to get an IntPtr pointing to an unmanaged memory area
      allocated by Marshal.AllocHGlobal. API for C# and VB.net is now
      consistent.
    * In the C/C++ API, const char* is now used for all ASCII strings
      not being modified by the underlying Delphi function. (This was not
      a bug but allows cleaner implementation of C++ wrappers)
    * NIC search did not clear already found cards. Make sure found NICs
      are only detected once each search.
* FEATURE: Implement adaptive timeout algorithm for UDP communication
    * Cards use the new adaptive algorithm until it is disabled by using
      the old set_timeouts function.

    * RTC4eth_FW_2.0.6.bin:	        2.0.6.0

    * The new ethernet firmware RTC4eth_FW_2.0.6.bin must be installed
	  on the card to provide correct communications with the RTC4netDLL(x64).dll
	* HPGL Converter is removed because it does currently not support the
	  new DLL versions.
* BUGFIX: Fix issues with datagram communication between card and host

          disturbances during card release processes.
